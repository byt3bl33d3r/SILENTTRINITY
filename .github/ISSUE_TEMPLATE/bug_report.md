**---- READ THIS PLEASE ----**

If the issue you're about to open falls under the following categories, I'll exercise my internet given right to comment with a meme and will close it immediately:

- A feature request is not a bug, please only open an issue ticket if you encounter a bug. Ideally if you want X feature to be added you'd submit a pull request, otherwise join the #silenttrinity channel in the [BloodHoundGang](https://bloodhoundgang.herokuapp.com/) Slack and yell at me there.

- Being rude and/or implying that I should drop everything I'm doing right now to fix it: just don't, you're getting this for free and I have no obligation to do anything 🖕.

- "X gets detected by AV/EDR product": this is inevitable for an open-source C2 tool. You can however submit a pull request to fix it and I'll award you with a "dank af" label which is legit street cred.

-  Opening an issue without filling out the required information below and/or giving an insanely vague description of the error you encountered

- Not using GIthub Markdown to format errors/output etc.. , I don't want to go blind please make it look pretty
