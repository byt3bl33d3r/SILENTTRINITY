# To Do

## Client
- ~~Refactor code so all Menu (context) instances are unique per TeamServer Connection as supposed to having them setup in the STShell class~~
- Autocomplete file system paths (Potentially could steal something from IPython)

## Server
- Need to figure out a sane way to upload/download large files
- Ability to host files via SMB, Webdav & HTTP(s)

#Implant
- Integrate Donut https://github.com/TheWover/donut cause its awesome.
- Figure out a sane way to upload/download stuff
- Switch over to AES-GCM and get rid of HMAC for transport encryption.
